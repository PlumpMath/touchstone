Current [semantic](http://semver.org/) version:

```clojure
[com.taoensso/touchstone "0.5.0"]
```

# Touchstone, an split-testing library for Clojure

## What's In The Box?
 * {TODO}.

## Status

Touchstone is still currently *experimental*. It **has not yet been thoroughly tested in production** and its API is subject to change. To run tests against all supported Clojure versions, use:

```bash
lein all test
```
## Getting Started

### Leiningen

Depend on Touchstone in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[com.taoensso/touchstone "0.5.0"]
```

and `require` the library:

```clojure
(ns my-app (:require [taoensso.touchstone :as touchstone]))
```

### {TODO}

## Touchstone supports the ClojureWerkz Project Goals

ClojureWerkz is a growing collection of open-source, batteries-included [Clojure libraries](http://clojurewerkz.org/) that emphasise modern targets, great documentation, and thorough testing.
